    Earthshaker was once an unnamed immortal being, able to take on various forms. He hails from Nishai, where he lay dormant until woken by an earthquake. Even in his slumber, Earthshaker was able to sense lifeforms around him. Assuming the form of a mortal beast, he is able to reshape his body at will, giving himself horns to defend against a hostile world.
    He has befriended Gargoyles, a species that inhabits Nishai. There is evidence that he has some relations with Behemoths, whose remains he uses as armor.
    Earthshaker is charged with protecting The Red Mountain, possibly a location in Nishai. He is hostile towards the Dire, equipping special totems imbued with light to counter its corruption.

    In an age lost even to his own memory, Ostarion fed his lust for eternal life not with spectral essence, but a nigh-unending harvest of bone. The walls of his palace were formed of fired bone; the streets paved with bones of every sort of creature and every enemy. And those of the flesh who entered this domain took great care, for the King was first and foremost a collector, and nothing moved in the Empire of Bone without summoning the gaze of his unblinking eyes.

The Ecclesiast-King of Elze nursed a desire for pain — forbidden pain. In a less prominent political figure, such desires might be considered unwise, but in a monarch of his stature, to satisfy such thirsts would have threatened the virtue of the Divine Throne itself. Therefore he turned to his dungeon full of demonologists, promising freedom to whoever could summon a personal succubus of torment and bind it entirely to his service. The creature who arrived, Akasha by name, visited upon him such exquisite torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his spare moments submitting to her clever torments—eventually abdicating all his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King's neglect of state brought on an uprising. He was dragged from his chamber and hurled from the Tower of Invocations, and at the moment of death, Queen of Pain was let loose into the world, freed from servitude—freed to visit her sufferings on anyone she deigned to notice.
